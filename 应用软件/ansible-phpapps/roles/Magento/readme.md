Magento是企业级系统，安装非常讲究

~~~
Upgrading the Magento applications and extensions you obtain from Magento Marketplaces and other sources can require up to 2GB of RAM. If you are using a system with less than 2GB of RAM, we recommend you create a swap file; otherwise, your upgrade might fail.
Composer is required for developers who wish to contribute to the Magento 2 codebase or anyone who wishes to develop Magento extensions.
In addition, you must enable the Apache mod_rewrite and mod_version modules. The mod_rewrite module enables the server to perform URL rewriting. The mod_version module provides flexible version checking for different httpd versions. For more information, see our Apache documentation.
